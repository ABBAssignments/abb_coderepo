Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Deployment with Terraform
Overview
This project sets up an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Terraform, with Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration, role-based access control (RBAC), and monitoring capabilities.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
- An Azure account with permissions to create resources.
- Terraform installed on your machine.
- Azure CLI installed and configured.

Deployment Steps
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. Configure Variables:
   Edit the variables.tf file to set the required variables such as region, resource_group_name, etc.

3. Initialize Terraform:
   Run the following command to initialize Terraform and download the necessary provider plugins:
   terraform init

4. Plan the Deployment:
   Review the resources that Terraform will create:
   terraform plan

5. Apply the Configuration:
   Deploy the infrastructure:
   terraform apply

6. Access the AKS Cluster:
   After the deployment is complete, configure kubectl to use the new AKS cluster:
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <aks_cluster_name>

Configuration
Variables
- region: Azure region for resource deployment (e.g., westeurope).
- resource_group_name: Name of the resource group for deployment.
- aks_admin_group: Azure AD group for AKS administrative access.
Outputs
The following outputs are available after deployment:
- aks_cluster_name: The name of the AKS cluster.
- aks_cluster_id: The resource ID of the AKS cluster.
- kube_config: The kubeconfig for accessing the AKS cluster.
- aks_admin_group_id: The object ID of the AAD group used for AKS admin access.
- log_analytics_workspace_id: The ID of the Log Analytics Workspace for monitoring.
- key_vault_id: The ID of the Azure Key Vault created.
Monitoring and Observability
This project integrates with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics Workspace for observability. Logs and metrics will be collected from the AKS cluster to ensure performance and security.
Cleanup
To remove all resources created by this project, run:
terraform destroy
